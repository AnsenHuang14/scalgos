The problem is ready. Here are the 4 files I am attaching with this email:

    DNA.txt: Contains the problem statement and sample input/output. 
    DNA.java: Contains a sample solution in Java
    DNA.in: The judge's input
    DNA.out: The judge's output
    
To run, put above 4 files in a directory and enter "javac DNA.java && java DNA < DNA.in > DNA.out" in the command line.

I would prefer if someone went over my code and my English (especially the latter) to catch any errors.
